# Browser Defender

## About the Game

Browser defender is a shooter style game, based upon the Corona Labs Asteroid Game. It takes inspiration from that, as well as bullet hells such as Touhou project.

You are a "superior browser" (Firefox) who has to defend themselves from the oncoming onslaught of Internet Explorer 11s "injecting" (shooting) SQL code at the oncoming enemies, as well as fight off Lord Bing (has more health compared to IE11) and Java (Shoots JavaScript at you). Along the way, you receive help from power-ups such as Lua (which grants you a life),as well as other browsers (Chrome is like a shotgun, Safari is lightning fast, Opera has a disposable shield, Edge is immune to IE11).
