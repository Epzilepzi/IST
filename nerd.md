### **Devices**

#### **Routers**

A router is a device which receives and forwards data packets transmitted within a network. Routers determine where the data goes, whether its destination is within a network, or if it needs to be transferred to another network. Routers are mainly used as a means of connecting a local network, to other networks.

#### **Switches**

Like a router, a network switch is a device which directs traffic to and from devices on a network. The main difference between a router and a switch is that switches are mainly used within a network, whereas routers are mainly used to communicate between networks. Switches, hubs and routers may be built into a single device.
